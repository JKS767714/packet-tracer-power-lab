Packet Tracer Power Lab

This Cisco Packet Tracer lab demonstrates how to install a power supply in a network device and verify power status using the CLI. The lab helps learners understand how hardware power changes are reflected in device status outputs.

# Objectives

By completing the lab, I was able to:

Insert a power supply into a supported network device

Identify power-related hardware components

Use CLI commands to verify and interpret power status changes

#Prerequisites

Cisco Packet Tracer installed

Basic familiarity with Cisco devices and the CLI

# Lab Overview

In this lab, I physically/digitally added a power supply to a device in Packet Tracer and then confirmed the change using CLI commands. This simulates real-world scenarios where hardware components are installed or replaced and must be validated by operations staff.

# Lab Steps (High-Level)

Open the Packet Tracer topology.

Drag the power supply module and place it into the appropriate device slot.

Power on the device

Access the device CLI.

Run the appropriate command(s) to verify power status.

Observe and confirm the updated power state.
